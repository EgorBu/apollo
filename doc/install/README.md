# Installation

Apollo can be installed in two ways:

* Through [`pip install`](pip.md).
* As a [docker container](docker.md).

New users are recommended to use the container image so that they do not have to setup the complex
environment.

It is required to [initialize the database](db.md) once Apollo is installed.
