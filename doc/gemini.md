# Apollo vs. Gemini

[Gemini](https://github.com/src-d/gemini) is mainly written in Scala and targets the production and
bloody enterprise. Thus it is relatively less flexible but should be high performing and efficient.
Apollo is a polygon for innovation which feeds all its research goodies to Gemini. Regarding the
scalability, both are scalable and can process big amounts of data.

Besides, Apollo is owned by Machine Learning team and Gemini is owned by the Applications team.

### Which one to choose?

If your goal is doing research and trying new ideas, stick with Apollo. If you want to deduplicate
terabytes of sources in your organization, go with Gemini.
