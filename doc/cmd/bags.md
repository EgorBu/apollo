# Bags command

This command converts input repositories to unordered weighted bags of features that are stored in DB, writes MinHashCuda batches, and writes the Ordered Documents Frequency model as well as the optional Quantization Levels model. You can specify the following arguments:

- `-r`/`--repositories` : Path to the input files
- `--parquet`: If your input files are Parquet files
- `--graph`: Path to the output Graphviz file, if you wish to keep the tree
- `-l`/`--languages` : Languages to keep, defaults to all languages detected by Babelfish
- `--dzhigurda`: Index of the last commit to keep, defaults to 0 (only the head), 1 is HEAD~2, etc
- `--bow`: Path to the output batches
- `--batch`: The maximum size of a single batch in bytes
- `--min-docfreq`: Specific minimum document frequency of each feature, defaults to 1
- `--docfreq`: Path to the output Ordered Document Frequency model
- `-v`/`--vocabulary-size`: to specify the maximum vocabulary size, defaults to 10 million
- `--partitions`: to repartition data, this will specify new number of partitions 
- `--shuffle`: to repartition data, this will allow data shuffling (vital if number of partitions increases !) 
- [Spark and Engine arguments](https://github.com/src-d/ml/blob/master/doc/spark.md)
- [Cassandra/Scylla arguments](db.md)

You must also specify arguments for the **features**:

- `-x`/`--mode`: Mode to select for analysis, defaults to `file`, can also be `repo` or `func`
- `--quant`: Path to the output Quantization Levels model (optional)
- `-f`/`--feature`: Features to extract from each item, at the moment among the ones below


| Feature  | Description                        |
|----------|:---------------------------------:|
| graphlet | Converts the UAST to a weighted bag of graphlets, a graphlet of a UAST node is composed from the node itself, its parent and its children|
| lit      | Converts the UAST to a weighted bag of literals (UAST node role)
| id       | Converts the UAST to a weighted bag of identifiers (UAST node role)
| children | Converts the UAST to a bag of (internal type, quantized number of children) pairs, see [quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)) for more info |  
| uast2seq | Converts the UAST to a bag of sequences of nodes, we use Depth First Search for the traversal of the UAST | 
| node2vec | Converts the UAST to a bag of vectorized sequences produced through a random walk

You can check out the [Babelfish documentation](https://doc.bblf.sh/) for more information about UASTs. The weights of each feature in a bag are always computed from the observed frequencies. 

- `--<feature>-<arg>`: For each of the above features you can also specify arguments:

| Feature  | Flag                              | Default | Description |
|----------|:---------------------------------:|:-------:|:------------:|
